## Heritages
* **Goblin** — Japanese Macaque (Snow Monkey) genetically engineered to develop human neural tissue. Historically used for cheap labor in confined or dangerous spaces, now a vibrant and hardy culture. Face infantilizing stereotypes due to small size and fur. Cannot reproduce with humans, but often adopt human foundlings. Traditional culture strongly values well-being of the community, caution towards outsiders. Very little sexual dimorphism. Lunar populations tends to be dense, but spread out.
* **Longfolk** — Born to spacefaring parents and raised in zero-G environments, tallfolk grow longer and lankier than those in Dianis' generated gravity. Tend to be blunt and direct from generations of living among spacefaring hazards, although culture strongly values hospitality. Usually around 7 feet tall.
* **Golem** - Human neural tissue implanted into an electromechanical body. First golems were created as result of experiments attempting to create an electronic system capable of interfacing with the Inside.
