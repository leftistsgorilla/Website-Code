# Neocities Website

The aim of this project is to a) learn HTML in order to b) get my custom Forged in the Dark setting uploaded as an easily accessible website via NeoCities.

## Goals
The goal is to have a somewhat interactive website with animations made in Aseprite, dice rolling, and maybe some other helpful features like drop tables, etc.

### Detailed End-Goals

1. Animations implemented into playbooks to give more context/depth
